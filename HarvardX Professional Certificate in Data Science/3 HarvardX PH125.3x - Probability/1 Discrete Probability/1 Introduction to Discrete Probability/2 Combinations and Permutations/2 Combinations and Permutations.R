### 2 Combinations and Permutations

## Combinations and Permutations
# Code: Introducing paste() and expand.grid()
# joining strings with paste
number <- "Three"
suit <- "Hearts"
paste(number, suit)

# joining vectors element-wise with paste
paste(letters[1:5], as.character(1:5))

# generating combinations of 2 vectors with expand.grid
expand.grid(pants = c("blue", "black"), shirt = c("white", "grey", "plaid"))


# Code: Generating a deck of cards
suits <- c("Diamonds", "Clubs", "Hearts", "Spades")
numbers <- c("Ace", "Deuce", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six", "Seven", "Eight", "Nine", "Ten", "Jack", "Queen", "King")
deck <- expand.grid(number = numbers, suit = suits)
deck <- paste(deck$number, deck$suit)

# probability of drawing a king
kings <- paste("King", suits)
mean(deck %in% kings)

# Code: Permutations and combinations
# Correction: The code shown does not generate all 7 digit phone numbers because phone numbers can have repeated digits. It generates all possible 7 digit numbers without repeats.

all_phone_numbers <- permutations(10, 7, v = 0:9)

permutations(3,2)    # order matters
combinations(3,2)    # order does not matter

## sapply
# Code: Function for birthday problem Monte Carlo simulations
# Note that the function body of compute_prob() is the code that we wrote in the previous video. If we write this code as a function, we can use sapply() to apply this function to several values of n.

## DataCamp Assessment: Combinations and Permutations
# Exercise 2. Sampling with replacement
# Assign the variable p_yellow as the probability of choosing a yellow ball on the first draw.
# Using the variable p_yellow, calculate the probability of choosing a yellow ball on the sixth draw.

# Assign the variable 'p_yellow' as the probability that a yellow ball is drawn from the box.
p_yellow <- yellow/(cyan+magenta+yellow)

# Using the variable 'p_yellow', calculate the probability of drawing a yellow ball on the sixth draw. Print this value to the console.
p_yellow

# Exercise 3. Rolling a die
# Assign the variable p_no6 as the probability of not seeing a 6 on a single roll.
# Then, calculate the probability of not seeing a 6 on six rolls using p_no6.
# Assign the variable 'p_no6' as the probability of not seeing a 6 on a single roll.

# Exercise 4. Probability the Celtics win a game
# Calculate the probability that the Cavs will win the first four games of the series.
# Calculate the probability that the Celtics win at least one game in the first four games of the series.
# Assign the variable `p_cavs_win4` as the probability that the Cavs will win the first four games of the series.

# Exercise 5. Monte Carlo simulation for Celtics winning a game
# Use the replicate function for B <- 10000 simulations of a four game series. The results of replicate should be stored to a variable named celtic_wins.
# Within each simulation, replicate the sample code to simulate a four-game series named simulated_games. Then, use the any function to indicate whether the four-game series contains at least one win for the Celtics. Perform these operations in two separate steps.
# Use the mean function on celtic_wins to find the proportion of simulations that contain at least one win for the Celtics out of four games.
# This line of example code simulates four independent random games where the Celtics either lose or win. Copy this example code to use within the `replicate` function.
