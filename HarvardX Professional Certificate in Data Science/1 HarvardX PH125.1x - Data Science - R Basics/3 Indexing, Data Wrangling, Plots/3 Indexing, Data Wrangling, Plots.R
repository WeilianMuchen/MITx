## 3.1 Indexing

# defining murder rate as before
murder_rate <- murders$total / murders$population * 100000
# creating a logical vector that specifies if the murder rate in that state is less than or equal to 0.71
index <- murder_rate <= 0.71
# determining which states have murder rates less than or equal to 0.71
murders$state[index]
# calculating how many states have a murder rate less than or equal to 0.71
sum(index)

# creating the two logical vectors representing our conditions
west <- murders$region == "West"
safe <- murder_rate <= 1
# defining an index and identifying states with both conditions true
index <- safe & west
murders$state[index]

x <- c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)
which(x)    # returns indices that are TRUE

# to determine the murder rate in Massachusetts we may do the following
index <- which(murders$state == "Massachusetts")
index
murder_rate[index]

# to obtain the indices and subsequent murder rates of New York, Florida, Texas, we do:
index <- match(c("New York", "Florida", "Texas"), murders$state)
index
murders$state[index]
murder_rate[index]

x <- c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e")
y <- c("a", "d", "f")
y %in% x

# to see if Boston, Dakota, and Washington are states
c("Boston", "Dakota", "Washington") %in% murders$state




## 3.2 Basic Data Wrangling

# installing and loading the dplyr package
install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)

# adding a column with mutate
library(dslabs)
data("murders")
murders <- mutate(murders, rate = total / population * 100000)

# subsetting with filter
filter(murders, rate <= 0.71)

# selecting columns with select
new_table <- select(murders, state, region, rate)

# using the pipe
murders %>% select(state, region, rate) %>% filter(rate <= 0.71)

murders %>%  filter(rate <= 0.71) %>% select(state, region, rate) 

# creating a data frame with stringAsFactors = FALSE
grades <- data.frame(names = c("John", "Juan", "Jean", "Yao"), 
                     exam_1 = c(95, 80, 90, 85), 
                     exam_2 = c(90, 85, 85, 90),
                     stringsAsFactors = FALSE)



## 3.3 Basic Plots

# a simple scatterplot of total murders versus population
x <- murders$population /10^6
y <- murders$total
plot(x, y)

# a histogram of murder rates
hist(murders$rate)

# boxplots of murder rates by region
boxplot(rate~region, data = murders)
